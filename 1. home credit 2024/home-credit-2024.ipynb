The goal of this competition is to determine how likely a customer is going to default on an issued loan. The main difference between the [first](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) and this competition is that now your submission will be scored with a custom metric that will take into account how well the model performs in future. A decline in performance will be penalized. The goal is to create a model that is stable and performs well in the future.\n","\n","In this notebook you will see how to:\n","* Load the data\n","* Join tables with Polars - a DataFrame library
